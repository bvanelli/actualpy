## Bootstraping a new server and uploading a first file

The following script would generate a new empty budget on the Actual server, even if the server was not bootstrapped
with an initial password.

```python
from actual import Actual

with Actual(base_url="http://localhost:5006", password="mypass", bootstrap=True) as actual:
    actual.create_budget("My budget")
    actual.upload_budget()
```

You will then have a freshly created new budget to use:

![created-budget](./static/new-budget.png?raw=true)

If the `encryption_password` is set, the budget will additionally also be encrypted on the upload step to the server.

## Updating transactions using Bank Sync

If you have either [goCardless](https://actualbudget.org/docs/advanced/bank-sync/#gocardless-setup) or
[simplefin](https://actualbudget.org/docs/experimental/simplefin-sync/) integration configured, it is possible to
update the transactions using just the Python API alone. This is because the actual queries to the third-party service
are handled on the server, so the client does not have to do any custom API queries.

To sync your account, simply call the `run_bank_sync` method:

```python
from actual import Actual

with Actual(base_url="http://localhost:5006", password="mypass") as actual:
    synchronized_transactions = actual.run_bank_sync()
    for transaction in synchronized_transactions:
        print(f"Added of modified {transaction}")
    # sync changes back to the server
    actual.commit()

```

## Running rules

You can also automatically run rules using the library:

```python
from actual import Actual

with Actual(base_url="http://localhost:5006", password="mypass", file="My budget") as actual:
    actual.run_rules()
    # sync changes back to the server
    actual.commit()
```

You can also manipulate the rules individually:

```python
from actual import Actual
from actual.queries import get_ruleset, get_transactions

with Actual(base_url="http://localhost:5006", password="mypass", file="My budget") as actual:
    rs = get_ruleset(actual.session)
    transactions = get_transactions(actual.session)
    for rule in rs:
        for t in transactions:
            if rule.evaluate(t):
                print(f"Rule {rule} matches for {t}")
```
